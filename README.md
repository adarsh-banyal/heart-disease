# Predicting heart disease using machine learning

This project looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

More specifically , this project includes the following topics:

+ **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** - the process of going through a dataset and finding out more about it.
+ **Model training** - create models to learn to predict a target variable based on other variables.
+ **Model evaluation** - evaluating a model's predictions using problem-specific evaluation metrics.
+ **Model comparison** - comparing several different models to find the best one.
+ **Model fine-tuning** - once we've found a good model, how can we improve it?
+ **Feature importance** - since we're predicting the presence of heart disease, are there some things which are more important for prediction?
+ **Cross-validation** - if we do build a good model, can we be sure it will work on unseen data?
+ **Reporting what we've found** - if we had to present our work, what would we show someone?
